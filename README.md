# Majora's Mask 3D Remastered OST

##Description
This is a remastered soundtrack for Majora's Mask 3D that is supposed to give the OST a "Wind Waker HD treatment," where many of the samples, mixing, and effects have been revived. I used Foobar2000, FL Studio, Looping Audio Converter, and multiple soundfonts and plugins.

I know this repo is a bit lackluster for the moment, but over time I will continue to add new information about the OST... stay tuned on my Discord server for updates!

Also, please note that I tested these songs with the EUROPEAN version of MM3D, so if something happens to not work correctly on the USA version, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
