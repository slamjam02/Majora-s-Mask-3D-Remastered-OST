# Majora's Mask 3D Remastered OST

## Description
This is a remastered soundtrack for Majora's Mask 3D that is supposed to give the OST a "Wind Waker HD treatment," where many of the samples, mixing, and effects have been revived. I used Foobar2000, FL Studio, Looping Audio Converter, and multiple soundfonts and plugins.

If you have any questions or concerns, I will gladly help out anyone in the MM3D REMASTER OST section on my Discord server linked above. If by chance I see a comment saying "Sounds awful i hate it," for example, I will happily ignore it; however, if you have genuine feedback, I will absolutely pay attention.

I know this repo is a bit lackluster for the moment, but over time I will continue to add new information about the OST... stay tuned on my Discord server for updates!

Also, please note that I tested these songs with the EUROPEAN version of MM3D, so if something happens to not work correctly on the USA version, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
