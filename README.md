# Majora's Mask 3D Remastered OST

## Description

This is a remastered soundtrack for Majora's Mask 3D that is supposed to give the OST a "Wind Waker HD treatment," where many of the samples, mixing, and effects have been revived. I used Foobar2000, FL Studio, Looping Audio Converter, and multiple soundfonts and plugins.

If you have any questions or concerns, I will gladly help out anyone in the MM3D REMASTER OST section on my Discord server linked above. If by chance I see a comment saying "Sounds awful i hate it," for example, I will happily ignore it; however, if you have genuine feedback, I will absolutely pay attention.

## How To Install

### Citra:
* Make sure you have the latest version of Citra (Nightly or Canary)
* Download the ZIP file containing the soundtrack
* Extract the ZIP file
* Copy the ***RomFS*** folder to "C:/Users/[your username]/AppData/Roaming/Citra/load/mods/[Game ID]/"
* (If you want, you can just type in %appdata% in the Windows File Explorer address bar to jump to the "/Roaming/" folder)

Note: If you changed the folder in which Citra mods go, put the RomFS folder there, otherwise Citra will have no idea you installed it. The steps listed above are assuming you are using the default folder / drive.

#### Game ID values:
* USA = 0004000000125***5***00
* EUR = 0004000000125***6***00

### 3DS:
Luma LayeredFS (Safe):
* Make sure your 3DS is compatible with CFW and has Luma installed
* Open your SD or microSD card on your computer
* Create a folder in the "/luma/" folder called "titles"
* Create a folder inside of "/luma/titles/" with the proper game ID for your copy of MM3D (see above...)
* Download the ZIP file containing the soundtrack
* Extract the ZIP file
* Copy the ***RomFS*** folder to "/luma/titles/[Game ID]/" (Game ID values are under the Citra tutorial)
* Safely eject your SD or microSD card
* Put your SD or microSD card back in your 3DS
* Hold SELECT while your 3DS is turning on and make sure that "Enable game patching" is ticked on, and if it isn't, turn it on
* Press START to save your Luma options (this will reboot your 3DS)
* The next time you open the game, the soundtrack should be properly replaced

Note: Shop music and Milk Bar music both crash real 3DS hardware. As of 1.1, the mod is compatible with 3DS hardware via Luma LayeredFS and custom ROMs.

## Changelog

### V1.2
* Fixed volume for all of the songs, they should be more aligned with the volume of the original tracks
#### Songs added:
* Opening Chest
* Item Get

### V1.1
* Removed the Shop and Milk Bar (mono) tracks until I can fix the 3DS hardware crash. (If you play on Citra and want to keep these songs, download release 1.0.) This is a temporary fix; I will be looking into a permanent fix when I figure out why this occurs.

### V1.0
* Initial Release

## Other Info

I know this repo is a bit lackluster for the moment, but over time I will continue to add new information about the OST... stay tuned on my Discord server for updates!

Also, please note that I tested these songs with the EUROPEAN version of MM3D, so if something happens to not work correctly on the USA version, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!
